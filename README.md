# Date Converter
Convert English Date(AD) into Nepali Date(BS) and vice versa. This project was my first semester Project. The entire project has used simple C language to get the desired output and works fluently. Since this was my first major project, my codes might not be aesthetically pleasing for pro programmers. 
Coding in C is tough as it is a basic programming language with no Object Oriented features. Still with some basic features of C like array and methods I was able to perform the date conversion with basic logic and mathematical computations.

The two main modules in this program are:
A.BS to AD:
This another module in can be selected from main menu. In this module the program takes input i.e. the BS date and finally displays converted AD date. The entire module can be represented in algorithm as follow:
1.	Start
2.	Define the least possible Nepali date and its equivalent English date used in the converter.
(In this converter we have used 2000/01/01 as least possible Nepali date and its equivalent English date is 1943/04/14)
3.	Take Nepali date from the user.
4.	Count the total number of days between the least possible Nepali date (i.e. 2000/01/01) and the Nepali date entered by the user.
5.	Add the difference of two Nepali dates to the equivalent English date(i.e. 1943/04/14) and also check for the year being leap or not
6.	Display the final converted date.
7.	End.

B. AD to BS:
This module is similar to the BS to AD module with the particular and significant difference i.e. this module takes input i.e. AD date and displays the converted BS date. The entire module can be represented in algorithm as follow:
1.	Start
2.	Define least possible English date and its equivalent Nepali date used in the converter.
(In this converter we have used 1943/04/14 as least possible English date and its equivalent Nepali date is 2000/01/01)
3.	Take English date from the user.
4.	Count the total number of days between the least possible English date (1943/04/14) and the English date entered by the user.
5.	Add the difference of two English dates to the equivalent Nepali date (i.e. 2001/01/01).
6.	Display the final converted Nepali date.
7.	End
