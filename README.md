# Date Converter
Convert English Date(AD) into Nepali Date(BS) and vice versa. This project was my first semester Project. The entire project has used simple C language to get the desired output and works fluently. Since this was my first major project, my codes might not be aesthetically pleasing for pro programmers. 
Coding in C is tough as it is a basic programming language with no Object Oriented features. Still with some basic features of C like array and methods I was able to perform the date conversion with basic logic and mathematical computations.
